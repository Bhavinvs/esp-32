# ESP32 LED Control with Button Press
  
## 🚦 Project Description

This project demonstrates how to control an LED using a push button with the ESP32 microcontroller. The LED turns on when the button is pressed and held, and turns off when the button is released. This setup is ideal for understanding basic digital input and output operations with the ESP32.

## 📁 Files in This Repository

- `sketch.ino` – Arduino code to control the LED based on button press.

No downloads required—just click the link, press the green "Start" button, and interact with the button to see the LED respond accordingly.

## 🔧 How to Customize

- Modify the GPIO pins in `sketch.ino` to match your hardware configuration.
- Adjust the debounce delay if you experience flickering due to button bounce.
- Expand the project by adding multiple buttons or LEDs for more complex interactions.

## 📚 Learning Focus

- Understanding digital input and output with the ESP32.
- Implementing real-time control of peripherals based on user input.
- Debouncing techniques for reliable button press detection.
