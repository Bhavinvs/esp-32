# ESP32 Buzzer Siren Using For Loop

🔊 **Project Description**  
This project demonstrates how to generate a siren-like sound using a passive buzzer connected to the ESP32 microcontroller. A `for` loop is used to continuously vary the buzzer frequency, creating a rising and falling tone pattern similar to a siren. This setup helps in understanding tone generation and loop control with the ESP32.

🔧 **How to Customize**  
- Modify the GPIO pin in `sketch.ino` to match your hardware setup.  
- Adjust the frequency range and delay to modify the siren pattern.  
- Try implementing different patterns like ambulance or police sirens by varying the tone logic.

📚 **Learning Focus**  
- Generating tones using the ESP32 and a passive buzzer.  
- Using `for` loops for timing and signal modulation.  
- Understanding sound frequency control in embedded systems.
