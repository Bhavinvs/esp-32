# ESP32 Traffic Light Simulation Project (Wokwi)

This is a simple ESP32 project that simulates a traffic light system using LEDs, created using [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com) simulator.

## 🚦 Project Description

This project demonstrates how to simulate a basic traffic light (Red, Yellow, Green) using the ESP32 microcontroller. Each LED turns ON for a defined period to represent real-world traffic light behavior. This is helpful for understanding GPIO control, timing, and sequencing.

## 📁 Files in This Repository

- `sketch.ino` – Arduino code to control the traffic light sequence.
- `diagram.json` – Circuit layout for ESP32 with 3 LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green).
- `wokwi-project.txt` – Optional notes or raw link to the Wokwi simulation.

No downloads required — just click the link, press the green "Start" button, and see the traffic lights in action!

## 🔧 How to Customize

- Adjust LED timing in `sketch.ino` for different light durations.
- Try adding a pedestrian signal or button input for more complexity.

## 📚 Learning Focus

- GPIO control on ESP32
- LED sequencing and delay timing
- Real-world system simulation using microcontrollers
