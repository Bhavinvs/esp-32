# ESP32 Serial Monitor Display (Project 8)

## 🚦 Project Description

This project demonstrates how to use the Serial Monitor to display messages from the ESP32 microcontroller. It's an essential tool for debugging and monitoring the behavior of your programs by providing real-time feedback.

## 📁 Files in This Repository

- `sketch.ino` – Arduino code that sends messages to the Serial Monitor.
- `diagram.json` – Circuit layout for ESP32 (if applicable).
- `wokwi-project.txt` – Link to the Wokwi simulation for this project.

## 🔧 How to Customize

- Modify the messages in `sketch.ino` to display different information.
- Adjust the baud rate in both the code and Serial Monitor to match your requirements.
- Implement additional logic to display sensor readings or other dynamic data.

## 📚 Learning Focus

- Understanding how to use `Serial.begin()`, `Serial.print()`, and `Serial.println()` functions.
- Utilizing the Serial Monitor for debugging and real-time data display.
- Establishing effective communication between the ESP32 and your development environment.
