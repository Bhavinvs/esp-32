# ESP32 Servo Motor Control with ESP32Servo Library

⚙️ **Project Description**  
This project demonstrates how to control a servo motor using the ESP32 and the ESP32Servo library. The servo motor is programmed to rotate back and forth by 90 degrees at fixed time intervals. This project is ideal for learning the basics of servo motor control in embedded systems.

📁 **Files in This Repository**  
- `sketch.ino` – Arduino code to rotate the servo motor back and forth using the ESP32.  
- `diagram.json` – Circuit layout for ESP32 connected to a servo motor.  
- `libraries.txt` – Contains the required library: ESP32Servo.  
- `wokwi-project.txt` – Link to the Wokwi simulation for this project.

No downloads required—just click the link, press the green "Start" button, and watch the servo motor sweep between angles.

🔧 **How to Customize**  
- Adjust the rotation angles in `sketch.ino` to suit your specific use case.  
- Change the delay interval to control the speed of the sweep.  
- Add buttons or sensors to trigger servo movement interactively.

📚 **Learning Focus**  
- Controlling servo motors using the ESP32.  
- Using the ESP32Servo library for smooth and precise movement.  
- Implementing timed motion for automation and robotics applications.
