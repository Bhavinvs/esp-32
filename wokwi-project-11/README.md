# ESP32 For Loop Serial Monitor Output (Project 11)

## 🚦 Project Description

This project demonstrates how to use a `for` loop in Arduino code with the ESP32 to print a sequence of values in the Serial Monitor. It's a simple exercise to understand control flow and how looping works in microcontroller programming.
