# ESP32 LED Blink Project (Wokwi)

This is a simple ESP32 project created using [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com) to **blink an LED** for a specific duration.

## 💡 Project Description

The ESP32 turns an LED on and off for a defined period of time. This is a basic project for learning how to control GPIO pins using Arduino code.

## 📁 Files in This Repository

- `sketch.ino` – Main code to blink the LED.
- `diagram.json` – Wokwi circuit diagram (ESP32 + LED).
- `wokwi-project-1.txt` – Optional notes or original simulation link.
