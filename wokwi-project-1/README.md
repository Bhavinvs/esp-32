# ESP32 LED Blink Project (Wokwi)

This is a simple ESP32 project created using [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/) to **blink an LED** for a specific duration.

## üîß Project Description

The ESP32 turns an LED on and off for a defined period of time. This is a basic project for learning how to control GPIO pins using Arduino code.

## üìÅ Files in This Repository

- `sketch.ino` ‚Äì Main code to blink the LED.
- `diagram.json` ‚Äì Wokwi circuit diagram (ESP32 + LED).
- `wokwi-project.txt` ‚Äì Optional notes or configuration.

## üöÄ How to Run the Project

1. Go to [Wokwi ESP32 simulator](https://wokwi.com/).
2. Create a new ESP32 project.
3. Replace the default files with these:
   - `sketch.ino`
   - `diagram.json`
4. Click **Start Simulation**.

You should see the LED blinking according to the programmed timing.

## ‚úÖ What You Learn

- How to control digital output (LED) with ESP32.
- How to use `delay()` and GPIO pins.
- How to simulate ESP32 projects on Wokwi.

This is a beginner-friendly project and a great first step into working with ESP32 microcontrollers.
