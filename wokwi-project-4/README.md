# ESP32 LED Control with Two Switches

🚦 **Project Description**  
This project demonstrates how to control an LED using two push buttons with the ESP32 microcontroller. One button turns the LED ON, and the other turns it OFF. This setup is ideal for understanding digital input logic control using multiple input sources with the ESP32.

📁 **Files in This Repository**  
- `sketch.ino` – Arduino code to control the LED using two switches.  
- `diagram.json` – Circuit layout for ESP32 with two push buttons and an LED.  
- `wokwi-project.txt` – Link to the Wokwi simulation for this project.

No downloads required—just click the link, press the green "Start" button, and use the two buttons to turn the LED on or off.

🔧 **How to Customize**  
- Modify the GPIO pins in `sketch.ino` to match your hardware configuration.  
- Expand the project by adding more LEDs or switches for complex control.  
- Implement edge detection if you want to register single button presses rather than continuous press.

📚 **Learning Focus**  
- Understanding digital input and output with the ESP32.  
- Managing multiple digital inputs to control a single output.  
- Structuring clean control logic for device states (ON/OFF).
