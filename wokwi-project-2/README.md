ESP32 Traffic Lights Project (Wokwi)
This is a simple ESP32 project created using Wokwi to simulate traffic lights using LEDs.

🛠️ Project Description
The ESP32 controls three LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green) to mimic a traffic light system with defined timing for each signal. This is a basic project to demonstrate sequencing and timing using GPIO pins and Arduino code.

📁 Files in This Repository
sketch.ino – Main code for traffic light control logic.

diagram.json – Wokwi circuit diagram (ESP32 + traffic LEDs).

traffic-project.txt – Optional notes or configuration.

💡 How to Run the Project
Open Wokwi.

Upload the contents of this repository (or open using the .json project file).

Press the Play button to simulate the ESP32 running the traffic light system.

Watch the LEDs switch in the standard traffic light sequence.

✅ Features
Simple simulation of traffic light timing.

Adjustable durations for each signal.

Easy-to-understand ESP32 and Arduino implementation.
