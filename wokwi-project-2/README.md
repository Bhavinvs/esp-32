# ESP32 Traffic Lights Project (Wokwi)

This is a simple ESP32 project created using [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com) to **simulate traffic lights using LEDs**.

## üõ†Ô∏è Project Description

The ESP32 controls three LEDs (Red, Yellow, Green) to mimic a traffic light system with defined timing for each signal. This is a basic project to demonstrate sequencing and timing using GPIO pins and Arduino code.

## üìÅ Files in This Repository

- `sketch.ino` ‚Äì Main code for traffic light control logic.  
- `diagram.json` ‚Äì Wokwi circuit diagram (ESP32 + traffic LEDs).  
- `traffic-project.txt` ‚Äì Optional notes or configuration.

## üí° How to Run the Project

1. Open [Wokwi](https://wokwi.com/).
2. Upload the contents of this repository (or open using the `.json` project file).
3. Press the **Play** button to simulate the ESP32 running the traffic light system.
4. Watch the LEDs switch in the standard traffic light sequence.

## ‚úÖ Features

- Simple simulation of traffic light timing.
- Adjustable durations for each signal.
- Easy-to-understand ESP32 and Arduino implementation.
